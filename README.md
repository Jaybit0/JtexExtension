# JTeX Extension

JTeX is a sophisticated high-level language designed to simplify and enhance the process of creating PDF files. It introduces a set of new syntax elements designed to streamline your workflow, while fully maintaining compatibility with traditional LaTeX code. This means you can write in LaTeX within JTeX, and your code will remain untouched by the compiler, establishing JTeX as an exceptional extension to LaTeX.

The real power of JTeX lies in its dedicated JTeX Client, which enables seamless conversion of `.jtex` files to `.tex` files. Furthermore, it offers automatic conversion of these files to PDF format, making document creation more straightforward than ever.
